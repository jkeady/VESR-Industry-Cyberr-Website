                <h2>My Top Four Personal Values</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>Hard Work</h3>
                    <p> Hard work is very important to me because without it, I wouldn't be where I am today. The value of hard work was instilled in me by my parents, who believe that hard work makes you successful and makes you feel acomplished. If I don't work hard, I don't earn anything good in life, nothing comes to me if I just sit around all day.  </p>
                    <p>This value was instilled in me by my parents and my teachers. My parents are successful because of their hard work, and they taught me that great success comes from working hard.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Honesty</h3>
                    <p>The phrase "honesty is the best policy" isn't just a phrase to me, it means a lot. Honesty can come from many different things: relationships, owning up to mistakes, setting boundaries, etc. I think that life is a whole lot easier if were all being honest to each other, even if it can be brutal sometimes.</p>
                    <p>The friends I have made definitely helped me develop this value. They encouraged me to be honest to them even though it may come off as blunt, but its what keeps the friendship strong. Lying won't get you anywhere. </p>
                </div>
                 <div>
                    <h3>Empathy</h3>
                    <p>Empathy is important to me because it strenghtens my relationships with others. It is also a way to ease people up and get to know them better. Treating people with kindness is imporant, because they will treat you with the same. </p>
                    <p>I definitely get empathy from my mom. She always sees the good in people no matter how many mistakes they make. She taught me to treat people with kindness and respect.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Resilience</h3>
                    <p>Resilience is very important to me. Life brings so many challenges, but it is important to never give up when things get tough. Not only that, but resilience can also inspire others around you to stay strong. </p>
                    <p>I have made so many mistakes in life, and I have thought about giving things up when they got too hard, but then I think about my grandpa, who has fought literal battles and wars, sacrificing his safety for this country. He inspires me to stay resilient.</p>
