                <h2>My Role: Creative Director</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3>What does a creative director do?</h3>

                    <h3>Possible Ethical Issues</h3>
                    <p>An ethical issue that could arise in creative directing is focusing on forcing micro-transactions onto the player to get them to spend more money withing the game, which is manipulative.

                    <h3>Possible Cybersecurity Issues</h3>
                    <p>Data breaches could be a big issue. Hackers could target gaming companies or platforms to steal players' personal and financial information, including login credentials and payment data. Another issue that could arise is with cheating software. Cybercriminals could use malicious software for cheating in multiplayer games which would be unfair to other players.</p>

                    <h3>Best Cybersecurity Practices</h3>
                    <p>Good cybersecurity practices to keep game companies up and running smoothly could be with using strong authentication such as multi-factor authentication to protect player and employee accounts. Regular updates to games could patch vulnerabilities quickly and keep the games from being corrupted. Another good practice would be to limit employee access only to systems specifically in their respective roles. This reduces the risl of internal breaches or accidental leaks. </p>
